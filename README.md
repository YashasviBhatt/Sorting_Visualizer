As the Name suggests, this Project visualizes various types of **Swap-Based Sorting Algorithms** and gives you an understanding of how does sorting actually performed.

It is not important that you received a sorted array/list but the mechanism that generates you the sorted array.

This project visualizes following sorting algorithms:
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Cocktail Sort
- Gnome Sort

## To run this Project please follow these steps

1. Open _command prompt_ or _powershell window_.
2. Type this command<br>`git clone https://github.com/YashasviBhatt/Sorting_Visualizer`<br>and press enter.
3. Go inside the _Cloned Repository_ folder and open _command-prompt_ or _powershell window_.
4. Please install **TKinter** using<br>`pip install tkinter`<br> and press enter in either _command_prompt_ or _powershell window_ as _administrator_.
5. After Installing _TKinter_ execute the program<br>`python sorting_visualizer.py`.


**As mentioned, The project only visualizes _Swap-Based Sorting Algorithms_ but ideas are accepted on how to visualize _Non-Swap-Based Sorting Algorithms_ using same approach, make a pull request if you want to add your ideas/contribution and maintainers will look after it :blush:.**
